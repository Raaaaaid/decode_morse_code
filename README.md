# Decode Morse Code - Codewars Challenge

`decode_morse_code.py` provides a solution for the following three Codewars challenges:

 - [Decode the Morse code](https://www.codewars.com/kata/54b724efac3d5402db00065e) (simply decode morse codes to plain text)
 - [Decode the Morse code, advanced](https://www.codewars.com/kata/decode-the-morse-code-advanced) (convert bit sequences with a consistent transmission rate to morse codes and decode these morse codes)
 - [Decode the Morse code, for real](https://www.codewars.com/kata/decode-the-morse-code-for-real) (same as previous task but the transmission rate of a message is inconsistent)

Further information can be found in the problem descriptions of the challenges.
